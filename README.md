# UX Design

The aim of this website was to showcase previous project aswell as showcasing my HTML, CSS & JavaScript skillset. The site design is comprised of a sidebar and content section which remains constant between all webpages. A CSS grid was implemented which was made responsive through the use of media queries for each device screen. The design of the website was made playful with the addition of hover effects on links as well as underline animations on hover for the 'more' header and the 'info' header.

#### Example of some of the hover effects
